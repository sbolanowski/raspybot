## Execution

To launch the RaspyBot Dashboard, use the following command:

```bash
./run_dashboard.sh --ip <IP_ADDRESS>
```

### Parameters:
- **`--ip <IP_ADDRESS>`**: If you specify an IP address, the dashboard will connect directly to the Raspberry Pi using the provided IP.
  <br>
- **Without `--ip` parameter**: If no IP address is provided, the dashboard will use `nmap` to search for the Raspberry Pi on the local network automatically.

### Example:

To connect to the robot with a specific IP address:

```bash
./run_dashboard.sh --ip 192.168.1.100
```
<br>

To automatically search for the Raspberry Pi on the local network:

```bash
./run_dashboard.sh
```
